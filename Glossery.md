1. Field: Understood as a space, that is, an ensemble of positions in a relationship of mutual exclusion. Constructing the space of establishments thus meant constructing the system of the criteria that could account for this set of meaningful and significant differences that objectively separate these establishments or, if you will, enable the set of relevant differences among these institutions to arise. 
   -- The positions within a field are defined by their differences from one another. An institution's identity is shaped by what it is not. To understand the "space of establishments" (like universities), one must identify the rules of the game - the specific criteria that create significant and recognized differences.  These are the relevant differences that give the field its shape and determine the status and power of each position.
2. Methodic Intent: Signs to describe everything that goes into actual scientific research, particularly the long series of initiatives that must be improvised, sometimes in order to take advantage of a given situation, or everything that has to be done without too much attention to theoretical considerations, while still holding to the conviction that there is no decision, however small, that does not make an equally crucial contribution to the scientific construction of the object under analysis.
3. Social Frames of Perception: the taxonomies used in ordinary experience, their social genesis, and the practical conditions of their implementation -- particularly the usually practical context of their use -- but also the differential power of differentiation, that the different principles of classification collectively used to construct a social world -- for example, economic or cultural criteria ("class") and ethnic criteria ("race") -- effectively wield in the objectivity of the practices of the different categories of agents in accordance with the position they occupy in the objective classifications.
  -- We do not see the world as it "really" is. We see it through a set of invisible social frames or classification systems (taxonomies) that we learn from our society. Crucially, these ways of classifying the world are not neutral; they are imbued with power and have real, objective consequences on our lives and actions. The act of making a distinction is never innocent; it is an act of power that has consequences. Labeling one person "manager" and another "employee" creates a power dynamic, for example.

4."Misrecognition" (MÃ©connaissance): This is the crucial concept that makes the social world a stable formation. Misrecognition is the process by which people accept arbitrary, socially constructed conditions that propose divisions as natural, inevitable, and legitimate. Scientific Analysis works in the opposite direction. It actively de-naturalizes these structures by showing the hidden tension that created them.
