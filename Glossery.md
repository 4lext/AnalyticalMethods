1. Field: Understood as a space, that is, an ensemble of positions in a relationship of mutual exclusion. Constructing the space of establishments thus meant constructing the system of the criteria that could account for this set of meaningful and significant differences that objectively separate these establishments or, if you will, enable the set of relevant differences among these institutions to arise. 
   -- The positions within a field are defined by their differences from one another. An institution's identity is shaped by what it is not. To understand the "space of establishments" (like universities), one must identify the rules of the game - the specific criteria that create significant and recognized differences.  These are the relevant differences that give the field its shape and determine the status and power of each position.
